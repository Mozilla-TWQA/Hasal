Performance Test 
===========================
"Hasal" this word is came from Indigenous Taiwanese "Bunun", and it means hail. Why we choose this word is because we expect our testing could like the hail, fast and weighty. And through our testing could bring more improvement on our performance or quality.

* Install video recording codes and libs
* Install video recording main program
* Install opencv

```
virtualenv ~/.hasalenv            # or "make clean dev-env"
source ~/.hasalenv/bin/activate

pip install selenium

# For Ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install wget libav-tools ffmpeg libavc1394-0 libavformat-extra-53 libavfilter2 libavutil-extra-51 mencoder libavahi-common-data xsel xclip
wget https://github.com/bgirard/Gecko-Profiler-Addon/blob/master/geckoprofiler-signed.xpi?raw=true
wget https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/3.0.0.zip
follow this link[http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/06/22/install-opencv-3-0-and-python-2-7-on-ubuntu/] to install the opencv


# For Mac OS:
brew install ffmpeg --with-fdk-aac --with-ffplay --with-freetype --with-frei0r --with-libass --with-libvo-aacenc --with-libvorbis --with-libvpx --with-opencore-amr --with-openjpeg --with-opus --with-rtmpdump --with-schroedinger --with-speex --with-theora --with-tools
brew install libav
brew tap homebrew/science
brew install opencv3
manual download the opencv2 package, compile and install
download the opencv2 package here : https://github.com/Itseez/opencv/archive/2.4.13.zip
  unzip the package 
  cmake the folder unzipped 
  make
  make install
  ln -s /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cv2.so virtualenv_path_you_create/lib/python2.7/site-packages/cv2.so
OR you can use brew install opencv --with-ffmpeg -v, please make sure you go not error when use that command

```

# VM Template
You can download the VM tempalte for Hasal framework environment from vagrant.
* vagrant init shako/hasal
* vagrant up --provider virtualbox

# Setup
* Create a google doc, add doc id in lib/environment.py

# Usage

```
bash runtest.sh suite.txt
```
You can also specify some environment variable to control some other function, for example:
* `ENABLE_PROFILER=1`: enable all profiler when executing script, including avconv, gecko profiler, performance timing, har
* `DISABLE_AVCONV=1` : disable avconv when enable all profilers
* `CLOSE_BROWSER=0`  : keep the brower after script finished

You can also specify the number of running and retry after shell script, for example:
* `bash runtest.sh suite.txt 30 10`: run 30 times and retry 10 times when error happened

Output folder structure as below:
* `/output/images/sample/[case_class_name]_[timestamp]`: sample images capture before or after execution steps
* `/output/images/output/[case_class_name]_[timestamp]`: images converted from desktop recording video 
* `/output/videos`: video recording during case execution
* `/output/profiles`: profile recording during case execution
* * `.bin`: the Geckon profile recording, can be viewed on https://cleopatra.io/
